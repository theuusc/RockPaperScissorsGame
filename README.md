2. Download the Rock Paper Scissors executable. 

3. Have fun playing the game.

4. Disclaimer: if your antivirus reports a problem, It's because executable files created with PyInstaller or similar tools may use compression techniques to bundle everything into a single file. Some antivirus programs might flag compressed files as potentially harmful. But don't worry, all python code and the tools I use to create executables are from reputable and trustful sources.

## How to Play

1. The game window will appear, allowing you to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

2. After making your selection, the computer will randomly choose its move with a smooth animation effect.

3. The result will be displayed indicating who won the match or if it's a tie.

4. The score will be displayed at the bottom of the result.

6. If you dont wanna play more, just click on the `exit` button and the game will automatically close.
